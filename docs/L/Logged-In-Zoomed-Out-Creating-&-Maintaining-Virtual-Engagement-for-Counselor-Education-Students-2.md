## Distance Learning Challenges Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic
The U.S. Department of Labor found that the pandemic ignited greater labor force demand for essential workers (i.e., healthcare professionals, counselors, teachers) than non-essential workers (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021). Higher education attempted to fill this need as 56.6 million American students completed their academic year at home (Education Week, 2020). COVID-19 mitigation efforts stimulated a mass migration towards distance learning (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020). In March 2020, many counselor education programs drastically switched to distance formats to diminish the spread of the COVID-19 virus and abide by national quarantine mandates (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020). Many university educators struggled with learning new technology in a short time frame and providing an interactive learning environment via distance learning platforms (Serhan, 2020), and such challenges were transparent prior to the pandemic. For instance, in a study that evaluated counselor educators experiences in online education, over 50% of counselor educators reported that their most significant challenge was transitioning their teaching styles from traditional classroom environments to models best suited for online formats (Snow et al., 2018). In addition, from a student perspective, distance learners struggle with maintaining engagement and feeling connected with faculty (Coker et al., 2021). Therefore, counselor education programs are now called upon to focus on distance teaching andragogy and student engagement.

Prior to COVID-19, research surrounding online counseling training involved a focus on learning outcomes and professional vulnerabilities related to translating clinical procedural knowledge and applied skill sets over digital interfaces (Myers & Sweeney, 2005; Li & Su, 2021). The Western Association of Counselor Education (WACES) has developed the Journal of Technology in Counselor Education and Supervision (JTCES) and best practices have been curated from the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision for faculty use (ACES Tech Interest Network, 2017) to meet the online teaching resource demand for counselor educators and reduce strain on faculty. However, resources are still sparse for virtual learning specifically refined for the unique positionality of counselor education professionals (Chen et al., 2018).

### *Video-conferencing Fatigue & Disengagement*
Disengagement refers to students’ inattentiveness or withdrawal from course material and activities (Chipchase et al., 2017). Though video conferencing itself is not a new platform for distance learning, since the outbreak of COVID-19 videoconferencing fatigue became a new phenomenon that many individuals experienced, particularly with increased lengths of time. Though there are many positive reports of videoconferencing in relation to remote work (i.e., shorter time cost, higher work efficiency, positive association with accomplishing group tasks, etc; Denstadli et al., 2012), videoconference fatigue has the potential to negatively impact these benefits and reduce individual well-being. Factors that contribute to video-conference fatigue include (a) continuous focus on a screen for extended periods of time, (b) minimal non-verbal cues amongst meeting attendees, and (c) minimal interaction or view of others when screen sharing for lengthy time periods (Bailenson, 2021).

Similar to the U.S. workforce, many counseling programs made the adjustment to remote learning platforms to continue education in response to COVID-19 mandates. Though remote formats were a quick solution during the pandemic, one of the most common challenges of educators is maintaining long-term engagement of counseling students, while battling videoconferencing fatigue. In their research, Maimaiti and colleagues (2021), found several instructor factors that contributed to student disengagement for online learning, such as (a) limited utilization of breakout groups, (b) limited use of webcams, (c) lack of remote tool functions, and (d) mismatched expectations of student and teacher roles. In addition, those practicing online education must be aware of the potential risks of burnout and anxiety.

### *Loss of Learning Opportunities*
The advent of the pandemic ushered a loss of learning opportunities. Potential learning loss within distance learning is identified in the literature as recognizing barriers towards student preparedness. While universities sought to provide resources for instructors related to distance learning (i.e., electronic learning management systems, digital engagement, and assessment), instructors report occupational overwhelm and concerns about learning loss amongst counseling students (Moore et al., 2021). The shift to distance learning created difficulties for counseling students related to (a) lack of resources to succeed in distance learning, (b) quality of supervision, (c) concerns of Zoom fatigue within home environments, and (d) obstacles accessing hyperlinks, as well as internship and practicum sites (Aguilera-Hermida, 2020; Snow et al., 2018). Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge potential areas of learning and equip counselor education instructors with evidence-based strategies for reducing limitations.

### *Telehealth Gaps*
The considerations of distance teaching for counselor educators underscore the increasing pressure to train CITs with technological competencies. There is an ongoing teaching demand for many counseling professionals to utilize technology-mediated tools in counseling, such as telehealth (Juarez Palma, 2021). However, there are limited resources for enhancing telehealth competencies in CITs (Juarez Palma, 2021). Telehealth involves audio/video conferencing technology for psychotherapy assessment and treatment (ACA, 2014). While CACREP provides guidelines related to the impact of technology within counseling and the process (i.e., CACREP Technology Standards 2.F.1.j. & 2.F.5.e.), CITs are not required to undergo telehealth training. Furthermore, though counselor educators and clinicians may use the National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC) telehealth guidelines, the ACA Code of Ethics (2014), and CACREP guidelines, telehealth training resources are still within the infancy stages (McCord & Saenz, 2015). Gaps in technological training may inversely impact CITs, allowing them to feel less effective and connected to their clients through online platforms. Theoretically, acknowledging distance education gaps related to the telehealth interface can better equip instructors to amplify interactions between instructors and CITs.

### *Theoretical Framework for Distance Learning*
Distance education has expanded across multiple institutions, but challenges exist with maintaining quality distance educational programs (Serhan, 2020). To address the issue of limited research, Hathaway (2009) examined quality elements in higher education and the influence towards students’ perceptions of distance learning experiences. The results of Hathaway’s research developed into the Theory of Online Learning Quality, which identifies six dimensions of distance learning that are vital to a quality student experience: (a) instructor-learner, (b) learner-learner, (c) learnercontent, (d) learner-interface, (e) learner-instructional strategies, and (f) social presence. Further, the Theory of Online Learning Quality helps to influence the quality and extent of meaningful learning within courses using distance formats (Hathaway, 2009). Through this theoretical framework broadly addressing online learning, we believe that these dimensions can be integrated into counselor education using experiential teaching methods in distance formats. We further explore the six dimensions in depth to have a better understanding of their influence on distance learning.

The quality of instructor-learner interaction is essential and requires consistent feedback from instructors to develop trust and rapport among students (Sebastinanelli et al., 2015). Elements that help provide quality learner and instructor interaction include timely responses from the instructor for communication, frequent and meaningful feedback, and the ability for instructors to recognize students as individuals (Hathaway, 2009). Examples of instructorlearner interaction in counselor education include specific feedback on a student’s observations of counseling techniques and additional guidance outside of class for students with increased challenges.

The learner-learner dimension refers to instruction that allows students to share their professional experiences and reduces the demand for instructors to facilitate lengthy lectures (Peltier et al., 2007). Technological engagement (i.e., video chats, blogs, video conferencing) and meaningful engagement (i.e., providing and receiving peer feedback, role-playing techniques, and learning from peer comments) are areas of learner-learner instruction. Counselor education students may benefit from this dimension in breakout groups with their peers or having alternative methods of demonstrating learned knowledge (i.e., video assignments, mock sessions, etc.).

Learner-content refers to specific interactions within teaching that aid students in transferring information into objective knowledge, focusing on teachercentered approaches (Hathaway, 2009). A significant portion of the learner-content element includes the instructor providing clear and concise objectives (Dennen et al., 2007). Counseling educators instructors may do this by listing their objectives prior to each lecture, particularly as they related to CACREP standards. Next, learner-interface refers to the technology format that courses utilize to deliver content. Learner-interface is a crucial component where there is little to no faceto-face or remote interaction (Hathaway, 2009). Though many instructors are provided with a set learner interface based on the direction of their institutions, it is recommended that instructors have adequate knowledge of the various elements of the designated interface and construct their course assignments in a structured manner. Furthermore, all instructors of the department must utilize a similar interface structure for consistency. For instance, counseling instructors can have students upload all projects to the interface (i.e., Canvas, Blackboard, Googleclassrooms, etc.) versus sending them emails.

Learner-instructional strategies refer to instructors’ techniques to facilitate learning and engage course participants (Hathaway, 2009). Due to the experiential nature of counselor education, instructional strategies are particularly important for distance courses. Increased engagement leads to increased counseling competencies, helps foster a connection with students, and ultimately retains students within counseling programs (Bruneau & Reilly, 2021). Counselor educators are encouraged to implement formative assessment methods to help increase the quality of learner-instructional strategies, as they provide feedback to instructors on ways they can redirect teaching. For example, counselor educators may use the Counselor Competencies Scale-Revised (CCS-R; Lambie et al., 2018), which includes a combination of formative and summative feedback assessing CITs skills development and professional competencies.

The final dimension of Hathaway’s (2009) theory includes social presence, to alleviate students’ feelings of isolation. Though it includes several dimensions listed thus far, social presence essentially relates to interacting with students as students rather than a number. Examples of a social presence include instructors responding to discussion board posts as opposed to simply grading, observing, and relaying specific areas of growth and progress that the instructor has witnessed. For instance, counseling instructors can also use social media to encourage belongingness through class hashtags and blogs. Each of the dimensions requires interaction and responsibility of both the instructor and student. However, the instructor reinforces the dimensions by setting the online environment’s tone, maintaining consistency, and building rapport with their students.
