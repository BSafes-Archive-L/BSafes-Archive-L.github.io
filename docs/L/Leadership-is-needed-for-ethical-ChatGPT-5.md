## Conclusion 
The ChatGPT software tool has raised significant questions for the future of higher education.  Many scholars to date have presented arguments against the tool’s utility in classrooms, citing plagiarism, authentication, and academic integrity as key concerns. There are also mixed views on whether it should be eligible for authorship in scholarly work. Our critical reflections here, rather than pose a negative view of ChatGPT, we seek to offer a series of possible approaches that would support higher impact learning opportunities for students. That is, by embedding AI like ChatGPT into subjects and courses, we might be able to teach students ethical use of such devices. 

Greater effort must be placed however on future proofing subjects and degrees. While AI can help students learn, it does not substitute learning. It does, however, provide an alternative pathway to learning. For academics seeking to support their students to transition, soft forms of encouraged support through ChatGPT may be appropriate. Early assessment could receive feedback from ChatGPT, with the quality of the student prompts assessable. It can help students to identify areas they have missed, provide light guidance on where they might read more, and foster a sense of connection (albeit human-robot connection) to supplement existing peer and teacher connections. 

It can be easy to exercise fear in the advent of new tools that challenge us. And, for many universities, a fear-based ban response is an example of this. Instead, and perhaps unlike papermills, ChatGPT can be encouraged in the same way software tools like Grammarly can be used to support learning (Thi & Nikolov, 2022). The use of the tool requires a change in the way students are assessed, however. Instead of asking students to regurgitate the theories in a textbook, ask them to demonstrate their comprehension by applying that knowledge to complex and fictitious cases. If the tool is asked to apply a particular theory to a particular organisation (our test prompt was ‘Does authentic leadership apply to Apple?’ and ChatGPT provided a reasonable response that connected the theory to elements of Apple’s CEO and business practices. When asking ChatGPT to determine and defend the ‘best’ leadership style for Apple if it were post losses, the AI chatbot’s response was less definitive. It is likely in these sorts of authentic assessment questions – where the answers are multiple – that will enable students to learn with the aid of ChatGPT, but not exclusively with it.

Likewise, there is also opportunity to consider assessment that is less traditional, such as drawing a storyboard for a process-related assessment, or making a podcast about a core topic. While the students can still have ChatGPT supplement their language, or provide tips on making a podcast, it does not purely replace the student creating the podcast; an assessment-for-learning activity.

We offered a suite of possibilities in this short commentary for ChatGPT in higher education. We suspect that over time, these will continue to grow alongside the challenges of embedding a tool that provides much of the conventional answers to some instructional models of teaching theory.  We do, however, encourage scholars to remain emboldened by the propensity for richer and more authentic ways of learning… with the right assessment and learning design.
