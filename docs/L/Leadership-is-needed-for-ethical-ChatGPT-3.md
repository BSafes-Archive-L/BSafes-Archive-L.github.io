## The good and the bad of AI ChatGPT 
ChatGPT has sent ripples through higher education and education more broadly, with almost 5,000 published works on the topic already (as per Google Scholar, 18 February 2023), although the peer-reviewed literature is some way away with eight published articles currently listed on Web of Science, most of which are still in early-access. There are few quality studies released in top-tier journals at present on the topic. As of 21 February 2023, there were 21 articles listed in Scopus that use ChatGPT in title, abstract, or keywords.

These studies, with considerable brevity, highlight a position on ChatGPT, including Editor-inChief of Science, Holden Thorp (2023), which indicates “Machines play an important role, but as tools for the people posing the hypotheses... and making sense of the results”, or put more simply, it is not an author on a paper. This is not a consensus perspective though, with at least four studies to date citing ChatGPT as a co-author (see Stokel-Walker, 2023). ChatGPT itself indicates that this should be based on careful assessment of contributions (when asked “Should ChatGPT be listed as an author on academic papers?”): 

>> *Ultimately, the decision of whether to list ChatGPT as an author on an academic paper should be based on a careful assessment of its contributions to the work and should be guided by established academic conventions and ethical standards.*

Although, in the context of blind studies, human reviewers correctly identified 68 percent of ChatGPT generated abstracts and 86 percent of genuine abstracts, but incorrectly identified the rest. This indicates, from a practical perspective, that a doctoral candidate with minimal training in grading papers or integrity-detection may have considerable challenge in identifying when students use the AI tool to cheat.

In considering practice, universities have varied responses to date as the first semester delivery dates loom. Some universities have expressed the opportunity the ChatGPT application offers, with the University of Tasmania (2023) releasing a Statement on the Use of Artificial Intelligence to students and staff:

>> *You can use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn, just like you would study with a
classmate or ask a friend for advice. You are not permitted to present the output of
generative AI as your own work for your assignments or other assessment tasks. This
constitutes an academic integrity breach. In some units, a unit coordinator may explicitly
allow or require the use of AI in your assessment task.*

RMIT University (2023, n.p.) in Australia is “embracing ChatGPT for education”, and some academics are building free online courses to train academics in the use of ChatGPT (see Eager, 2023). In contrast, University of Hong Kong banned students from using the tool entirely (Yau & Chan, 2023), and Sciences Po (2023) in France has listed significant sanctions including “exclusion from the institution, or even from French higher education as a whole”. Bengaluru RV University in India indicates it will do spot-checks with the ban (Bengaluru News, 2023).

The Reddit ChatGPT – an online forum – offers an early case of the opportunity that ChatGPT provides for students to cheat on their studies. On 21 February 2023 for example, one popular post included a two-line memetic call-and-response “Open AI: ‘We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.’ College students:” followed by an image of a student with an A+ paper, a “what if you never had to do homework again” on the page, and a book titled “The Homework Machine” (see Reddit, 2023). Such narrative is not uncommon. In Australia, peak body the Universities Australia responded by highlight that universities in Australia are updating integrity policies and redesigning exams to “account for the risk students will use sophisticated artificial intelligence to cheat” (Panagopoulos, 2022). In an interview, Professor James Stacey Taylor identifies that 14 of his 163 students were caught using the ChatGPT chatbot to cheat (Wen, 2023).

Indeed, when we asked ChatGPT “What is the main risk of using ChatGPT-3 for assignment writing” it summarised:
>> *While ChatGPT-3 can be a helpful tool for generating ideas and providing structure for your writing, it is important to use it in conjunction with your own critical thinking, analysis, and research. It is also important to be aware of the risks associated with relying too heavily on ChatGPT-3 and to take steps to avoid plagiarism and ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information you include in your writing.*

So, there are risks to overreliance, and it could provide useful opportunities for students to engage more deeply in learning practices.
