## Discussion
The present study examined the functioning of academic stress and academic resilience vis-àvis student satisfaction with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. In so doing, it advanced theoretical knowledge of the effects of academic stress and academic resilience on the satisfaction sensed by students with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This investigation is also relevant to tertiary level educational processes in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic circumstances during which all educational institutions must employ online learning methods.

This study revealed that academic stress negatively influenced student satisfaction with online learning and demonstrated that satisfaction with online learning decreases with increased academic stress. This finding is aligned with the outcomes of studies previously conducted in Romania (Chraif, 2015) and Korea (Joo et al., 2012) that have reported the negative correlation of academic stress with student satisfaction. This result can be attributed to the fact that stress sensed by students results in their inability to function appropriately and thus hinders their growth and development (Freeburn & Sinclair, 2009).

In the current context of the pandemic, online learning has forced students to shift from their comfort zones of face-to-face classroom learning. Students are likely to experience stress when they sense excessive demands and are compelled to adapt to discomforting conditions (H. J. Kim et al., 2019). In academic settings, in particular, academic stress stimulates negative emotions in students and thus affects the learning process, leading to a more negative evaluation of the pedagogy. In other words, academic stress can reduce the satisfaction students feel with online learning in contexts when they are compelled to engage in such methods.

The present study measured online learning satisfaction was measured through student engagement in the online learning process (Dziuban et al., 2015). Thus, student satisfaction was gauged through the extent of their involvement in the online learning process. The results indicated that the higher the academic stress experienced by the students, the lower their engagement in the online learning process. This finding is congruent with past studies that have discovered the negative correlation of academic stress with student engagement (Manikandan & Neethu, 2018; Raufelder et al., 2014). Students evincing higher levels of stress tend to be more disengaged with school-related activities, which manifests in passive behaviors such as not exerting sufficient effort in class, being bored, or giving up easily (Skinner & Belmont, 1993).

The moderator effect analysis revealed that the effects of academic stress on satisfaction with online learning depend on the academic resilience of individual students. When academic resilience is high, academic stress exercises a lesser impact on student satisfaction with online learning. Conversely, satisfaction with online learning is sharply reduced in students who display low academic resilience and feel academic stress. In other words, academic resilience buffers the negative effects of academic stress on the satisfaction students feel with online learning. This finding indicates the importance of academic resilience in dampening the effects of academic stress on student satisfaction with online learning.

Academic resilience denotes the capacity of a student to overcome academic adversities (Martin, 2013). This trait allows students to respond (e.g., cognitive, affective, behavior) adaptively to academic challenges (Cassidy, 2016). Students exhibiting high resilience are more likely to discover positive messages from everyday stressors than learners who are not resilient (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004). This rationale can explain why some individuals who experience high levels of stress are able to cope and even improve themselves (Grant & Kinman, 2012). Therefore, academic resilience facilitates students to adaptively respond to academic stress and to overcome adverse pressures. Academic resilience also contributes to student satisfaction. Students evincing high levels of academic resilience tend to be more satisfied with their academic experiences (Meneghel et al., 2019).

These results indicate the significant role discharged by academic resilience in the relationships between academic stress and student satisfaction with online learning processes. Academic resilience weakens the association between academic stress and satisfaction with online learning. This finding can be incorporated by instructors, academic advisors, and counselors when they design interventions to increase student satisfaction with online learning. The study results can also help students initiate plans to enhance their resilience, lower stress, and engage more enthusiastically in online learning sessions. Interventions that can ameliorate the ability of students to analyze their academic stressors and determine how to deal with them would help increase student satisfaction with online learning. Programs to strengthen the academic resilience of students may also be mandated to foster satisfaction in students with the online learning process.

The present study has offered robust support for the effects of academic stress on the satisfaction sensed by students with online learning and the moderating function of academic resilience. However, some limitations must be acknowledged. First, this study focused on internal factors related only to student satisfaction with online learning methods (e.g., individual academic stress and academic resilience). Such satisfaction could also be influenced by external factors (e.g., instructor support, technology, and online learning system). Therefore, this study only explains a small portion (12%) of the variance of student satisfaction with online learning. Kauffman’s (2015) review of factors influencing student satisfaction and successes with online learning has documented that both parameters are affected by internal as well as external factors. Success and satisfaction vis-à-vis online learning require interactions between students, instructors, and technology (Kauffman, 2015). Thus, prospective research projects must replicate and extend the findings of the current study by investigating the impact of both internal and external factors on the satisfaction of students with online learning. Second, disproportionately more females than males formed the participants of this study. The sample also encompassed more students from public rather than private universities. Even though no significant difference was observed in terms of these variables across demographic information, the existing research suggests that learner characteristics can impact student satisfaction with online learning (Kauffman, 2015). Therefore, further studies should aim for a more balanced gender and university-based distribution and capture other demographic information (e.g., socialeconomic status, availability of internet connection, and online learning tools). Third, this crosssectional study was conducted in the early stages of the pandemic. Academic stress levels and academic resilience are likely to have changed over time and to have influenced the satisfaction sensed by students with online learning. Also, individual students could have increased their ability to adapt and function more competently over time and with experience (Freeburn & Sinclair, 2009). Therefore, longitudinal studies are recommended to assess dynamic changes that occur over time in students with respect to academic stress, academic resilience, and satisfaction with online learning.
