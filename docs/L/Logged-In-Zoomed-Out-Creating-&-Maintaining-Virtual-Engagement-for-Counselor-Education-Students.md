## Abstract
Distance learning has significantly changed the face of counselor education and has greatly enhanced the learning process, becoming more prominent since the national pandemic of COVID-19. However, experiential learning, a primary component for counselor education students, can be particularly challenging for some instructors as they may struggle with developing key learning competencies and experiences via distance formats (Schreiber et al., 2021). Using the Theory of Online Learning Quality as a theoretical framework (Hathaway, 2009), we provide practical implications for how faculty can implement best practices for distance learning while maintaining active engagement for counseling students. In addition, we review online learning from a social justice lens, evaluating the diverse needs of various counseling students’ identities and the unique challenges they face that impact curriculum.

In response to the national pandemic of COVID-19, many counseling programs have had to make emergency transitions towards distance teaching and learning. Distance learning has many advantages, particularly for graduate students who balance responsibilities relating to full- time work or caring for their families (Snow et al., 2018). In addition, counselor educators can adopt various technological platforms and modalities to assist with counselor competencies and skills (Bruneau & Reilly, 2021). Despite the ability for creative technological advances to provide effective and meaningful instruction, some counselor educators struggle with implementing their teaching strategies to distance learning formats (i.e., synchronous and asynchronous online, remote, hybrid, etc; Schreiber et al., 2021), both at the masters and doctoral levels. Many counseling competencies are formulated via experiential learning, allowing students to practice counseling skills, thus increasing the challenge

to convert to distance platforms. Further, counselor educators must consider virtual counseling education and preparing counselors-in-training (CITs) with increased competencies for using alternative forms of counseling, particularly telehealth services (Juarez Palma, 2021).

The aim of this article is to (a) present distance learning challenges for counselor educators and students, (b) integrate the Theory of Online Learning Quality as a theoretical framework for counseling programs, and (c) provide practical implications to aid with student engagement for distance learning in counselor education. According to Snow and colleagues (2018), distance learning, online learning, or online education are interchangeable. For this article, the authors use distance learning to refer to counselor educators who participate in some or all of their education through a distance education formats. The purpose of this conceptual article is to apply Hathaway’s (2009) *Theory of Online Learning Quality* to provide tools for distance

counselor education (CE) professionals. The authors will briefly analyze current concerns and practices of online learning within counseling models and how they can amplify social and academic outcomes within online teaching. To best serve today’s counseling students, the authors provide implications for practice and highlight critical targets to enhance distance teaching.
