## Directions for Future Research
The following theoretical suggestions have several implications for future research and practice. Researchers are encouraged further to explore the differences in in-person and distance formats, to add to the literature, and aid counselor educators with successfully transitioning their teaching styles to distance formats. One-way researchers can explore format differences is to utilize assessments to analyze counselor education courses and student learning objectives. For instance, researchers may want to assess cross-modality differences in skills and competencies utilizing specific counseling scales, such as the Counselor Competencies Scale-Revised (CCS-R; Lambie et al., 2018) for students in the Techniques or Practicum courses, or the Ethical and Legal Issues in Counseling Self-Efficacy Scale (ELICSES; Mullen et al., 2014) for the Ethics course. Furthermore, researchers should consider qualitative methods to directly hear from distance counseling students related to their concerns and challenges and areas that have assisted with course success. Qualitative research may include focus groups for online students or thematic analysis from student journals, open-ended surveys, or blogs. Increasing knowledge of best practices for online courses may allow for further knowledge related to engagement, retention, and competency for students within the counselor education field.
