## Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak prompted the sudden transformation of all aspects of life; inevitably, the educational environment also changed. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic in March 2020. Educational institutions were thus compelled to shift from face-toface classes to online learning formats. Indonesian educational institutions predominantly applied only face-to-face or classroom instruction before the pandemic (Direktorat Jendral Pendidikan Tinggi, 2020). However, higher education institutions such as Open Universities (Universitas Terbuka) did offer Internet-based learning programs. The pandemic has turned online learning into a necessity for education (Dhawan, 2020) in countries worldwide, including Indonesia. The Government of the Republic of Indonesia issued a study from the home policy through the Ministry of Education and Culture as stipulated in Circular Letter No.15/2020 concerning Guidelines for Organizing Learning from Home in an Emergency for the Spread of COVID-19. This document regulates the implementation of online learning activities for all levels of education to ensure the application of the physical distancing principle to prevent the

transmission of COVID-19 and reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

Numerous adjustments are required to ensure learning efficacy during the pandemic. Students were worried that they would experience long-term disadvantages (Daniel, 2020). A survey of 1,008 college students conducted in the US during the pandemic found that student satisfaction dropped significantly after their courses were fully conducted online due to the pandemic. Only 19% of students were greatly satisfied with their online learning experiences: This figure evinced a decrease from the previously computed statistic of 51% before courses were conducted solely online (Means et al., 2020). Studies conducted before the pandemic also found that students of online courses reported lower satisfaction rates than the students receiving in-person instruction (Furlonger & Gencic, 2014; Johnson et al., 2000). In Indonesia, the study involving the students in Padang Sidimpuan, and Semarang also discovered that participants were less satisfied overall with online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic (Napitupulu, 2020; Priyastuti & Suhandi, 2020).

The satisfaction of students engaged in online learning reflects their evaluation of Internet-based learning experiences. This measure is considered pivotal for the assessment of online learning (Alqurashi, 2016). Learners who are satisfied display a more positive attitude toward online learning and achieve higher achievement levels than dissatisfied students (Dziuban et al., 2015). Such constructive stances manifest in their behaviors; for instance, satisfied students are more engaged, motivated, responsive, and contributory. Previously conducted studies have revealed that satisfaction with online learning is highly correlated with lower drop-out rates and that satisfaction performs an essential role in the academic performance of students (Hart, 2012; Meneghel et al., 2019). Therefore, the decrease in student satisfaction related to the online learning process during a pandemic is cause for concern.

Moreover, online learning also causes other psychological problems, such as increasing stress related to academic performance (Furlonger & Gencic, 2014). Academic stress occurs when existing education-related demands outweigh the adaptive resources commanded by students (Wilks, 2008). A previous study conducted with 1,129 students from several provinces in Indonesia found that academic tasks and teaching styles represented stressors for students engaged in online learning during the pandemic (Livana et al., 2020). Time management and the ability to understand course material represent other potential stressors for students engaged in online learning (Ota et al., 2016). If students fail to overcome these stressors, they are likely to experience academic stress that would, in turn, influence their sense of satisfaction. Some extant studies have highlighted that academic stress and student satisfaction are negatively associated (Cazan & Truța, 2015; Chraif, 2015; Lee & Jang, 2015; Tri & Sari, 2019). The higher the stress experienced by the individuals, the lower their satisfaction.

Resilience is a psychological condition that enables individuals to deal with stress, modify the impact of adverse events, and successfully adapt to adversity (Hobfoll et al., 2003; Olsson et al., 2003). Stressors are less likely to affect students who display high resilience (Siebert, 2005). Thus, some prior studies have reported negative correlations between stress and resilience (Cazan & Truța, 2015; Wilks, 2008). In the educational context, resilience is termed academic resilience and is defined as an adaptive response to learning-related difficulties. Academic resilience denotes the capacity of students to overcome acute and/or chronic education-related difficulties through adaptive responses in three domains: cognitive, affective, and behavioral (Cassidy, 2016b; Martin, 2013). Academic resilience can help students overcome and competently manage academic stressors.

Conversely, academic resilience was found to be a significant predictor of student satisfaction (Kim & Lee, 2020; Meneghel et al., 2019; Noh, 2017), an outcome that could be attributed to the increased adaptability of resilient students to changes. Highly resilient learners are likely to view setbacks as opportunities for development (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004). They tend to respond to academic difficulties in constructive ways (Leary & DeRosier, 2012). Studies have revealed that students who display high levels of academic resilience participate more enthusiastically in classes, achieve higher grades, report fewer school-related problems, and experience low academic fatigue. Therefore, highly resilient students were more contented with their academic lives than students who exhibited low resilience (Hwang & Shin, 2018). Put differently, student satisfaction depends on the level of academic resilience.

The COVID-19 protocols and the transition from offline to online learning processes are new experiences for Indonesian university students. Thus, the present study initiative aims to extend the knowledge attained through previous studies related to student satisfaction with online learning, education-related stress, and academic resilience during the pandemic. This study references previous findings that academic stress affects student satisfaction (Cazan & Truța, 2015; Chraif, 2015; Lee & Jang, 2015; Tri & Sari, 2019) and that academic resilience levels influence both academic stress (Cazan & Truța, 2015; Wilks, 2008) and student satisfaction (Hwang & Shin, 2018). These previously reported outcomes allow the postulation that academic resilience moderates the relationship between academic stress and satisfaction with online learning. In so doing, the present investigation intends to examine the moderating role discharged by academic resilience vis-à-vis academic stress and satisfaction with online learning. Students evincing low academic resilience and reduced capacities of overcoming academic stress are more likely to be dissatisfied or less satisfied with online learning experiences. Conversely, students who demonstrate high academic resilience and show greater capabilities of managing academic stress are more likely to express increased satisfaction with online learning. In other words, it is expected that academic resilience levels will moderate the relationship between academic stress and student satisfaction with online learning.
