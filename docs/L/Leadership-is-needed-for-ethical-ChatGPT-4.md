## The missing strand of ChatGPT research and practice 
It seems unclear as to a broad consensus on the practices of ChatGPT. Rudolph et al. (2023) provide a useful overview of the some of the recent histories of ChatGPT, which we do not seek to replicate. Instead, we turn our attention to the provocations that the AI technology may afford.  And these four proposed below also go beyond technology- and authentication-centric strategies proposed by van Dis et al. (2023). Their strategies argue for human verification, stronger rules of accountability, and a need for greater AI independence. However, they usefully highlight some benefits from changing skill needs and supporting academic training over time. These are important benefits. In this section, we discuss the need for greater character, foster better positive psychological outcomes like flow states, support student psychological need fulfilment, and developing capability for student assistance as they transition and build confidence.

### The need for good leadership in teaching ChatGPT
The issue of students cheating on their assignments is not new practice. One of the authors recalls a time when a student brought handwritten notes into an exam and in their toilet break read and proceeded to eat the note sheet to avoid detection. More recently, papermills and contract cheating firms have challenged the sector to detect the authenticity of work. One of the major challenges of online examinations, for example, was the ability to authenticate the student who did the exam using software like retina and keystroke monitoring (Butler-Henderson & Crawford, 2020). And for some, effective measures of detection, and prescription of significant punishment has been the proposed solution (Amigud & Dawson, 2019; Dawson et al., 2020). Yet, these systems and practice have still plagued higher education.  

In historical examples, Wright (2015) highlighted that significant proportions of his Harvard MBA students had engaged in cheating during their studies. In response, it was proposed that the character of students ought to be the solution. Of which, we agree. In a recent Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice editorial, the Editor-in-Chief introduced publication sections that focused on good leadership and educational psychology to better understand and enhance how students engage with learning (Crawford, 2023). In these scenarios it was the leadership of teachers that influenced the extent to which students would engage in effective or ineffective (e.g., cheating) learning. 

When asking ChatGPT “Can good teacher leadership improve students use of ChatGPT-3 to learn?”, it summarised: 

>> *Overall, good teacher leadership can play an important role in helping students use ChatGPT-3 effectively to learn. By providing guidance and direction, promoting critical thinking and analysis, providing formative feedback, and encouraging collaboration and discussion, teachers can help students become more effective and engaged learners.*

It is our proposition therefore that to combat prospective cheating or misuse of the ChatGPT application, and future artificial intelligence chatbots and tools, by cultivating a sense of moral character in students as an imperative. This may be through effective teacher role modelling, through leadership development opportunities, or through continuous self-awareness, ethics, and decision-making training to build critical thinkers with a firm moral compass. Such development is critical if moral disengagement and patterns of motivated forgetting of bad decisions is to be avoided, two key mechanisms by which students can feel comfortable with cheating (Shu et al., 2011). For this, effective leadership opportunities embedded into core curriculum may pose a possible antidote to whatever future convenience that students might be afforded by difficult-todetect cheating practices. The future-focused promotion of good practice and character development does not forego the need for detection, as undetected cheating could lead to future character erosion, but rather offers a multipronged response that serves as more effective than only focusing on prevention or prescription; a fact that mental health scholars have known for some time (e.g., LaMontagne et al., 2014).  

### ChatGPT as the potential to create better flow
While research is still emerging regarding the benefits of ChatGTP-3 for students, university lecturers have the potential to imagine the possible benefits that may prevail. It is possible it could support facilitation of a flow state. Flow is a theoretical construct from positive psychology referring to a state of immersion one might experience in an activity like assignment writing (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008). A student in a flow state might feel that time passes quickly with little effort; the act of writing may be enjoyable. Writing is already a complex activity but paired with deadlines, other academic pressures and stress, students undertake a substantial cognitive load when completing written-based assignments (Lea & Street, 1998). When asking ChatGPT “Can using ChatGPT-3 for written assignments help students experience a flow state”, it summarised: 

>> *Overall, while using ChatGPT-3 for written assignments may not directly cause a flow state, it can contribute to creating an environment that is conducive to achieving a flow state. By reducing the cognitive load required to complete the assignment, increasing motivation, and facilitating a sense of flow, ChatGPT-3 can help students have a more positive and rewarding writing experience.*

In the contemporary learning context, opportunities arise that may enable ChatGPT-3 to be used for creating essay plans, completing grammar checking, or generating suggestions for key content curation, and missing information. To support students to be more immersed in their learning, it is possible that the use of an AI tool – like ChatGPT – could free students from the demand for cognitive resources to reach a state of flow and become fully immersed in the task. This opportunity, with the right assessment and curriculum design, could enable students to be more critical in their learning, rather than anxious that they have a lack of references, or that commas are in the wrong place (Gravett & Kinchin, 2020). Such a focus may enable students to inquire about their content and material more deeply, and indeed engage in deeper forms of learning (e.g., Archer-Kuhn, 2020).

### ChatGPT as the potential to support student’s basic psychological needs
ChatGPT-3, we posit, also has the propensity to support students meeting their basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness to facilitate self-determination and bolster academic motivation and performance (Geary et al., 2023 Ryan & Deci, 2000).  ChatGPT has the potential to provide students with a sense of control and psychological autonomy needs by providing them with a sense of control over their writing. There is an implied assumption in the emergent literature that students will use ChatGPT-3 to write assignments for them (e.g., Pavlik, 2023; Perkins, 2023). What if it were used to support students’ academic writing and give them guidance and writing support without losing the student’s voice? We must reflect if this differs from the support a student might receive from their institution or professional editors.  ChatGPT-3 places autonomy in the hands of the student. ChatGPT-3 may also support students by bolstering their feelings of competence by equipping them with the skills and resources needed for a set writing task.

When asking ChatGPT “Can using ChatGPT-3 for written assignments help students experience a self-determination?” it summarised:

>> *Using ChatGPT-3 for written assignments can help students experience a sense of selfdetermination, as it allows them to have more control over their writing process and outcomes. With the help of the AI model, students can generate ideas, structure their writing, and receive feedback on their work. This can lead to a greater sense of autonomy and mastery over their writing abilities, which can in turn increase their motivation and engagement with the writing task. However, it is important to note that using ChatGPT-3 should not replace the development of students' own writing skills and critical thinking abilities, as these are essential for long-term success.*

There may be space for ChatGPT-3 to foster relatedness for university students. Could it provide a necessary type of social support for students? Real-time, 24/7 support is available for feedback, help, and suggestions. In a context where increasing numbers of university students feel lonely and isolated (Thomas et al., 2020), ChatGPT-3 could fill a part of this void. Of course, not to replace people, but to offer a response during times when others are not available. 

### ChatGPT as the student assistant, rather than the cheating aid
Given the ChatGPT context, it seems sensible to ask ChatGPT what it thinks about students using it as a tool. When asking ChatGPT “Can using ChatGPT-3 for written assignments help students build confidence and seek formative feedback?”, it summarised: 

>> *Overall, while using ChatGPT-3 for written assignments is not a substitute for the feedback and guidance of an experienced instructor, it can be a valuable tool for building student confidence and encouraging a culture of formative feedback. By supporting students in generating high-quality content, experimenting with different writing approaches, and improving efficiency, ChatGPT-3 can help students become more confident and engaged writers.*

While this bullish answer would perhaps be expected from a machine being asked to evaluate itself, it is worthwhile remembering that this is not actually ChatGPT’s opinion, but a confluence of societal opinion from its last knowledge update. And in dissecting the ChatGPT output, students can begin to leverage the tool to support and improve quality of submission, in line with the original ideals of AI first espoused back in the 1950s.

ChatGPT quite rightly acknowledges that without an evaluation step conducted by somebody with expertise, the output of the tool remains underutilised. That is, while the data may generally be correct, and it can support higher volume scholarly work (Liebrenz et al., 2023), it still needs a critical reader in its work. The way that ChatGPT works means that whilst it will produce output, the veracity of this output should always be questioned, and it is likely many students are still developing their capacity for critical thinking. In this way, using ChatGPT to produce a summative result is rife with risk. While students are presenting an acceptance of chatbots (Ragheb et al., 2021), and it is helping them succeed (Chen et al., 2023), it is likely to entrench existing views of the world rather than what the world ought to be.  

Instead, ChatGPT itself suggests a mechanism that the tool might be used to improve quality of submission for students. By requiring students to carefully construct their prompts and evaluate their results, potentially in the presence of a tutor in the form of formative feedback, ChatGPT can be used to support students and build their confidence. From a set of brief ideas, students can generate text in which they have more confidence, and check that text with their institutional tutor as a form of ‘soft help’. Assuming they build capacity to evaluate the value of the text and ensure that the final output is correct, this has the potential to produce a more useful result, reflecting the students’ ideas and approach, but allowing them to express themselves as a form of ‘transition pedagogy’.

In the realm of assessment ChatGPT, and similar AI chatbots, provide an opportunity for students to seek feedback on their assignments, and to have their beliefs questioned and challenged.  Students may be asked to write a reflection and then ask ChatGPT to challenge the assumptions they have made during the reflection. This activity may support elevated self-awareness and more critical thinking (see Figure 1).
