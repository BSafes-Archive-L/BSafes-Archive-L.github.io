## Challenges with Distance Learning
Many challenging questions have emerged with the increase of distance learning in response to COVID-19. First, there is a gap concerning findings on online learning effectiveness within counseling literature (Minton, 2019). In a systematic literature review of research themes in counselor education, Minton (2019) found that only 4% of literature applied to distance learning for counselor education. Minton (2019) further argues “scholarly attention to methods for and effectiveness of distance teaching and supervision is the most neglected area within counselor education and supervision” (p. 12). Therefore, these findings suggest that more attention is needed to address the lack of literature on distance learning for counselor education.

Distance counselor training programs have an increased risk of attrition and must become adaptive and intentional in addressing the needs of their students (Snow et al., 2018). Counselor education programs must especially adjust their teaching methods to ensure experiential learning takes place, given the skill-based nature of the counseling profession. Although blended and flipped classrooms are common learning approaches, little is known about successful online engagement in counselor education (Merlin-Knoblich et al., 2019). As the counseling field enters a transition of demand for counselors and online learning trends (Moore et al., 2021), counselor educators can use implications to enhance pedagogy and connectedness within remote learning spaces. In sum, this article explores theories that align with the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) standards and promote counselor educator development within distance counselor education programs.
