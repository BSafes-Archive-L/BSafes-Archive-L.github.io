## Conclusion
The expansion of counseling programs using distance formats requires counselor educators to advance online instruction and enact CACREP standards and learning objectives effectively. This study makes two valuable contributions for those engaging in online teaching and counselor education practice. First, this conceptual resource posits Hathaway’s Theory of Online Learning Quality as a theoretical framework and identity distance learning strategies integrated tasks with multiple levels of engagement translatable to lecturing, collaborative work and reflections. Secondly, the article underscores the need to recognize that successful distance teaching is more of a practice rather than a modality, and research in the field necessitates potentially using the Hathaway theory to build on instructor intentionality and engagement within virtual settings. In closing, more empirically tested methods should be pursued with counseling students, and programmatic developments should be developed and integrated to reduce strain and overwhelm among culturally diverse CITs.
