## Method
### *Participants*
A total of 337 undergraduate students who had experienced online learning during the pandemic were recruited for this study using the accidental sampling technique. In sum, 78.64% of the participants were female, and 21.36% were male. The ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 32 years (M = 20.56, SD = 1.91). Most of them were students at public universities (63.2%). The remaining 36.8% were enrolled in private universities in Indonesia. Participants were engaged from varied faculties and study programs, including Psychology (51.63%), Engineering (14.24%), Social Sciences (10,68%), Health Sciences (7.42%), and other disciplines (14.84%). The participant sample spanned firstyear to sixth-year undergraduate students, but the largest cohorts represented second-year (28.78%) and third-year (27.89%) undergraduates. Their average GPA was computed at 3.38 (SD = 0.36, range 1 to 4).

### *Measures*
**Predictor Variable**. *Academic stress* denotes the strain experienced by students because of the learning processes to which they are subjected. This sensing of pressure influences physical and psychological changes within students (Gadzella, 1994; Ota et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2011). This study measured academic stress through the subscale study-related stressor from the *Stressor Scale for College Student* (Ota et al., 2016). The *Stressor Scale for College Student* measures academic stressors in general, while this study was conducted in the context of the online learning process. Therefore, the measurement tool was modified by adding the online learning context and making adjustments as required to calculate individual perceived stress during the online learning process. An example item read, “I have to attend a lot of online classes.” This variable was assessed via seven items on a sixpoint Likert-like scale (1 = Strongly disagree to 6 = Strongly agree): a high total score indicated a high level of academic stress from the online learning process. The items formed a reliable scale (α =.85) with item validity (taken from corrected item-total correlation) ranging from.52 to.66.

**Moderator Variable**. *Academic resilience manifests as affective*, cognitive, and behavioral responses to overcome academic difficulties. This variable was measured using Cassidy’s (2016) Academic Resilience Scale-30 (ARS-30), whose Indonesian adaptation (ARS-Indonesia) has been validated by Kumalasari et al. (2020) as evincing satisfactory psychometric properties (α =.85). The Indonesian version met convergent validity criteria through a composite reliability calculation (CR=.91 -.99). It comprises items representing three principal dimensions: perseverance, reflective and adaptive help-seeking, and negative affect and emotional response. The perseverance dimension (9 items) refers to individual behaviors in response to academic difficulties. The reflective and adaptive help-seeking dimension (8 items) concerns cognitive responses in dealing with academic difficulties. The negative affect and emotional response dimension (7 items) relates to individual emotional reactions to academic difficulties. A scenario describing academic difficulty preceded the administration of ARS-Indonesia for this study. Participants were asked to imagine being in the described situation and were then asked to choose their likely feeling/reaction to each item statement. This sixpoint scale offered response options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). A sample item read, “I would just give up.” The higher the total ARS-Indonesia score, the more academic resilience likely to be exhibited by the individual. The ARS-Indonesia reliability coefficient for this study was computed at α =.89 with item validity (corrected item-total correlation) ranging from.22 to.71.

**Criterion Variable**. *Online learning satisfaction* is operationalized as the perceptions and evaluation of students apropos the online learning process. It is measured through the engagement levels displayed by students with the online learning process. This variable was calculated using the engaged learning subscale of Dziuban et al.’s (2015) Student Satisfaction with Online Learning instrument. The applied subscale comprises ten items on a six-point Likert-like scale (1 = Strongly disagree to 6 = Strongly agree). The statement “Online learning helps me understand course material” represents a sample item. Higher total scores indicate greater student satisfaction with the online learning process and results. The reliability coefficient for this study was computed at α =.90, with item validity (corrected item-total correlation) ranging from.55 to.76.

### *Procedure*
The Universitas YARSI ethics committee approved this study (Ethical clearance letter No: 027/KEP-UY/BIA/I/2021). Data collection occurred in June 2020, three months after the initiation of pandemic-induced online learning sessions. A cross-sectional study was conducted, and data were compiled using a self-reporting online survey. The link was distributed to the potential participants via social media groups, students, and the lecturer’s networks. Informed consent was obtained, and detailed information was provided on the data collection process on the landing page of the link. Students who agreed to participate in this study clicked “Next” and completed the survey. At the end of the questionnaire, participants could enter a prize draw to win one of 200 IDR 25.000 electronic vouchers.

### *Data Analysis*
Linear regression analysis was performed to process the data collected for this study. All statistical analyses were conducted using the JASP 0.14.0.0 software.
