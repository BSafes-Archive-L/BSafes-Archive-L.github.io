## Introduction 
### Rising stress and anxiety in university students
A growing body of research suggests that contemporary university students are vulnerable to stress and mental health issues (Bruffaerts et al., 2018; Prowse et al., 2021; Shaffique et al., 2020). In the United States, studies have found that approximately 60 percent of college students reported overwhelming anxiety, a statistic that has risen compared to previous years (ACHA, 2018). The prevalence of psychological distress among Australian university students in 2020 has also increased compared to the previous year ranging from 32 percent (high) to 39 percent (very high), according to Vernon et al. (2022).

The COVID-19 pandemic adds another layer of concern regarding student stress and anxiety. It has been widely reported that the global pandemic significantly impacted students' mental health, with the most impact on social relationships, learning and stress levels among Australian university students (Lyons et al., 2020; Vernon et al., 2022). Many students report lower levels of wellbeing and increased academic-related stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Dodd et al., 2021; von Keyserlingk et al., 2022) In the years that have followed, a similar pattern of statistics emerges that is too significant to ignore – student stress and mental health are core issues facing universities globally.

The core contributors to stress for university students are varied. Research shows that social and peer pressure (Beiter et al., 2015), academic work (Alghamdi et al., 2019), financial concerns (Beiter et al., 2015), academic pressure (Reddy et al., 2018), and balancing other responsibilities like work and family (von Keyserlingk et al., 2022) are significant sources of stress. Indeed, social and economic conditions have changed over the last few decades. Since the 70s, social shifts have dramatically increased living costs, educational costs, and competition for further learning and finding work post-degree (Marginson, 2016; Perrone & Vickers, 2003). Financial concerns are one of the leading sources of stress for university students (Adams et al., 2016; Beiter et al., 2015), with pressure to do well, graduate, and be employable a consistent pressure.

Universities have raised concerns that stress and perceived pressure among university students have created a fertile ground for freely accessible artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Stress has substantial implications resulting in often adverse effects on students' academic performance, a concern given that it is also widely reported that University students face significant psychosocial challenges during their studies (Deng et al., 2022; Pascoe et al., 2020). Students who experience high stress are particularly susceptible to engaging in plagiarism or the misuse of AI technology.  

### Rising rates of plagiarism and academic integrity breaches
Alongside rising stress rates, evidence suggests that rising rates of plagiarism and academic integrity issues among university students exist in a world of readily available online tools that can assist. McCabe et al.  (2016) found that the percentage of students who admit to cheating has increased significantly in recent years. In 1963, for instance, only 3 percent of students admitted to cheating on exams, while in 2015, that number had risen to 64 percent and some studies identify higher rates (Wright, 2015). Certainly, the means by which students can cheat has been made easier since the introduction of the internet. However, even prior to technology, there has been a long history of some students attempting to optimise their ability to pass milestones (e.g., exams, assignments) easier. 

Although the reasons for the increase in plagiarism and academic misconduct are complex and multifaceted, some researchers have suggested that the increased pressure on students to succeed academically, paired with the availability of technology, makes academic breaches far easier (Jereb et al., 2018; Surahman & Wang, 2022). Research has found that academic stress is positively linked with cheating behaviour (Ma et al., 2013) and students who are more likely to engage in plagiarism (Ehrich et al., 2016). It may be that students who feel academic pressure are prone to using AI to complete assignments and AI technology may be one way some students cope with stress. While once contract cheating was considered a concern to those students who could afford it (Newton, 2018), from 2023 onwards, scholars are already worried about the effects that new AI and large language models (LLMs) will have on academic integrity issues for universities.

### Concerns with artificial intelligence
While several concerns of artificial intelligence have been discussed including the diminished reputation of academic institutions resulting in the discouragement of employers from hiring graduates of a particular institution or the devaluing of a university qualification, one of the most pervasive concerns reported through early research is the impact on learning (Zhai et al., 2021).  In fact, higher education staff may be most concerned about the impact of AI on student learning.  Many academics have anecdotally admitted worrying about students misusing AI tools to plagiarise assignments or use AI to misuse research data (e.g., Bockting et al., 2023). Other potential drawbacks discussed include the cost of innovative technology to monitor or investigate academic misconduct associated with AI. Time and resources of academic staff who already report they are at capacity for their workload, overloaded or stressed themselves – especially those from underserved populations (Allen et al., 2020; 2021). Attempting to battle AI technology or prevent or detect its use may be considered futile by most academics, despite some students entering education with a convenience approach to learning, and some new scholarly perspectives are embracing the possibilities.  

This commentary seeks to examine the emergence of artificial intelligence that gave rise to the ChatGPT-3 chatbot. We begin with an overview of AI and ChatGPT’s development, and follow this with the common strengths and weaknesses scholars are already discussing in the literature.  We continue to add our own critical opportunities that support practitioners to develop their reasoning surrounding using, or leveraging, chatbot applications in their classroom. First, we argue that it is character-based leadership development that will support a response to the fear of cheating, not purely detection. Second, remove the noise from their studies to support deeper learning and flow states. Third, ChatGPT we argue, offers better student autonomy and wellbeing for learners. Fourth, we discuss opportunities for authentic assessment using the web application.  We conclude and discuss what this means in the context of our guiding research question, What are the opportunities of ChatGPT in higher education practice?
