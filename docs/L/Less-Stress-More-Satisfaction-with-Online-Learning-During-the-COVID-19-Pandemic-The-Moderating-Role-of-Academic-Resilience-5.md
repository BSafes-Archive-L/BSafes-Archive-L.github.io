## Conclusions
This study has evidenced the functions of academic stress and academic resilience in student satisfaction with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the investigation demonstrated that academic stress is negatively associated with student satisfaction with online learning; this relationship weakens when students display higher levels of academic resilience. This finding highlights the significance of academic resilience in dampening the effects of academic stress on the satisfaction of students with online learning formats. In practical terms, this outcome suggests that academic resilience should be inculcated and encouraged in students to facilitate an ameliorated handling of education-related stress and to increase their contentment with online learning methods.
