## Results
Participants reported moderate levels of academic stress (*M* = 29.58, *SD* = 6.35), high levels of academic resilience (*M* = 138.10, *SD* = 17.12), and moderate levels of satisfaction with online learning (*M* = 33.77, *SD* = 9.9). Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of these variables and displays their inter-correlations. As can be noted, a significant moderate negative correlation exists between academic stress and satisfaction with online learning (*r* = -.29, *p* <.001). This result signifies that the higher the stress sensed by students, the lower their satisfaction with online learning. No significant correlation was discovered between academic resilience and satisfaction with online learning satisfaction (*r* =.10, *p* =.77) or academic stress (*r* =.03, *p* =.57). These preliminary outcomes offer initial evidence that should be subjected to further analysis to examine the effects of academic stress on student satisfaction with online learning.

### Predicting Online Learning Satisfaction
Table 2 demonstrates that all predictors (academic stress, academic resilience, and interaction between academic stress and academic resilience) are collectively significant predictors of student satisfaction with online learning (*R2* = 0.12, F (3,334) = 15.74, *p* <.001). This model could only explain 12% of the variance in satisfaction with online learning. The interaction term, academic stress x academic resilience exercised a significant effect on satisfaction with online learning (*B* = −013, *p* < .01). Therefore, academic resilience moderated the effects of academic stress on student satisfaction with online learning (*B* =.013, *SE* =.004, *CI* = [−.021, −.005], *t* (3,334) = 2.54, *p* <.001). Figure 1 illustrates the moderation effect. 

Figure 1 depicts that academic resilience levels influence the relationship between academic stress and student satisfaction with online learning. Academic stress is likely to decrease online learning satisfaction by 0.50 in a group of students who evinced high levels of academic resilience. Additionally, academic stress tends to further reduce online learning satisfaction by 1.45 in students who display lower levels of academic resilience. Put differently, academic stress is likely to yield a three-fold decrease in the effects of academic resilience on satisfaction with online learning. This result highlights the significant impact exerted by academic stress and academic resilience on the satisfaction sensed by students with online learning.
