## Implications for Distance Learning Formats
Counselor educators play a vital role in devising and maintaining successful learning conditions for courses they teach, particularly for distance learning since where there is minimal to no face- to-face interaction (Li & Su, 2021). Counselor education has undergone programming, instructional design, and collaboration shifts amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic has a lingering impact on systematic remote learning, practicum and internship hours, and professional burnout (Hicks, 2021). Based on the negative consequences and factors contributing to disengagement for online learning, we provide implications for counselor educators who may utilize distance formats in their programs based on overlapping themes of Hathaway’s (2009) model. While Hathaway’s theory provides helpful conceptualization for distance teaching, the themes are fluid and overlapping in nature. To provide actionable and applied insights, the article has described theory to action strategies translatable for virtual learning. Further, we provide areas for future research and contribute to the gap in literature related to online learning in counselor education.

*Considerations for Online Counselor Educators*

### *Video-conferencing Strategies*
Due to the everyday challenges of videoconferencing, counselor educators are encouraged to consider the importance of student-student interaction. These include tasks that incorporate peer interaction, reinforce interaction in course activities, and allow students to build rapport with their cohort. Without peer interaction, courses may turn into long lectures and increase the risk of student disengagement (Chipchase et al., 2017). Depending on the platform for synchronous meetings, the breakout room function allows for students to increase personal engagement in smaller groups versus the class in its entirety (i.e., learner-learner). Further, implementing peer interaction can increase the group belongingness of students. The perception of group belongingness can help students to feel more connected and more interested in participating (Bennett et al., 2021). Another consideration for counselor educators is limiting webcam utilization and student requirements (i.e., learner-interface). Many educators carry the assumption that having the webcam off increases further disengagement (Maimaiti et al., 2021). However, limiting webcam usage can aid students with the increased pressure of feeling “on” for extended periods. Moreover, limited webcam usage can allow students to focus on the content rather than aesthetics, their facial expressions, and eye tracking (Bennett et al., 2021). Therefore, we suggest limiting webcam usage within structured time constraints, such as frequent collective screen breaks or limiting the length of synchronous meetings. Lastly, video conferencing can limit the class length and replace other high-impact strategies such as mentoring.

### *Social Presence*
Using theoretical frameworks like the Theory of Online Learning Quality of online learning can allow mentorships to extend beyond the classroom. Mentors often serve overlapping roles for mentees, including as teachers, advisers, and supervisors. In the era of COVID-19, mentors’ most important roles may be as advocates and confidantes, as their mentees face immense unease and uncertainty in their career and professional development. It is essential to also ask about life stressors outside of coursework, such as childcare and family obligations, to identify challenges and potential solutions early on (i.e., Instructor-Learner). Potential interventions include providing lists of resources and connections on campus (Kaufman, 2021). Mentors are encouraged to openly acknowledge that lingering influences of the pandemic can affect productivity and encourage mentees to be compassionate with themselves.

To mitigate mentorship concerns, it may be beneficial for counselor educators to continue facilitating telehealth learning interactions through mock sessions via video conferencing (i.e; Learner-Instructional strategies; Social Presence; Learner-Interface). Using technology platforms within the mentoring relationship can be beneficial to students’ professional development outside of class meeting times (Kaufman, 2021). Moreover, counselor educators can use technology-assisted mentorship by leveraging telehealth experts as guest lecturers (i.e., Learner-Content). Digital forms of mentoring have the potential to reach more youth and can provide more opportunities for growth in the profession.

### *Additional Virtual Learning Strategies*
Effective experiential distance classroom learning strategies can be effective tools in storytelling and teaching CIT’s. Snow and colleagues (2018) suggest virtual fishbowl class exercises provide meaningful feedback about client development (i.e; Learner-instructional strategies). In addition, Brewer & Movahedazah (2018), recommend collaborative virtual exercises such as using a discovery orientation to empower discussion, tactical learning, and simulated learning. After such exercises, counselor educators can assess learning styles, ways of work, and content interest through pre-class surveys/assessments such as online readiness assessments (Angelino et al., 2007: Snow et al., 2018). In a recent content analysis, Chen and colleagues (2020) found that of 48 articles, only four articles focused on online teaching strategies, despite urgent calls from researchers requesting future research surrounding experiential clinical training. Snow and colleagues (2018) offer strategies such as town hall meetings, webinars, and open discussion forums to build student connections to the counseling department and the greater university at large virtually (i.e., Social Presence). Such strategies demonstrate Hathaway tenants and provide applied behaviors to fill the gaps in research pertaining to effective online teaching (Chen et al., 2020).

### *Social Justice Implications*
Considering the mass adoption of distance teaching, educators must recognize social justice considerations, particularly as distance modalities are relatively new to most students (Correia et al., 2020). Hathaway’s (2009) model can equip counselor educators with culturally alert and social justice practices within counselor education. First, instructors must be cognizant of how student mental health may impact student engagement and productivity. Instructors can respond by improving their instructor-learner interactions (Hathaway, 2009). For instance, faculty can implement an inclusive syllabus to include various on-campus resources (i.e, mental health resources, library resources). In addition, faculty can solicit student needs and concerns to address the psychological distress associated with online learning in graduate classrooms (Sanandaji & Ghanbartehrani, 2021). Student wellness surveys may aid faculty in recognizing advocacy needs and opportunities for their distance learners (i.e., Instructor-Learner). An extensive amount of literature in higher education has addressed the importance of faculty offering guidance for students with obstacles outside of the classroom (Social Presence; Hathaway, 2009).

Counselor educators informed by the Theory of Online Learning Quality would need to: (a) actively reach out to graduate counseling students by informing them about local mental health resources, (b) work alongside student affairs and university-based counselors to streamline mental health engagement processes, and (c) use knowledge from student feedback to acknowledge the humanness of students and enhance their learning experience. Second, social-justice-oriented educators are encouraged to acknowledge resource and technology accessibility variations among student cohorts (Li & Su, 2021). For example, in spite of current advances in technology, increased affordability and access to technology remain a pressing social justice concern for counselor education.

Li and Su (2021) suggested that distance education has expanded counselor education pedagogy to wider racial and ethnic underrepresented populations, however substantial gaps remain in reaching rural, indigenous, and disadvantaged populations, drawing an alarming social justice concern. Counseling faculty should advocate for continued legislation and department policy that supports student access to technology, including sustained computer loan programs, mobile interface educational tools (i.e. Learner-Interface), and increased in-class and programmatic data collection to further determine benefits and areas for optimization in expanding online education support. Such advocacy may affect economic and educational barriers and contribute to the digital divide within online learning. In addition, counselors and educators should solicit students’ technological resources to offer distance learning training and consistent messaging about course expectations and objectives (Flores, 2017). Reflective exercises and assessments of student strengths and needs have successfully decreased the overwhelm of graduate students surrounding caretaking and familial obligations within academic settings (Decker et al., 2016). Instructors can also apply learner-interface concepts by creating easy-to-read resources about electronic platforms (i.e., Webcourses, Blackboard), developing a frequently asked questions page (FAQ), and enacting flexible protocol surrounding missed or late assignments for graduate students.

Lastly, instructors should empower students through social presence practices (Hathaway, 2009). Such strategies can offer instructors engagement tools, and more bandwidth for gatekeeping and ethical considerations. For instance, offering regular and consistent updates regarding learning opportunities and developing monthly times for check-ins. Examples include instructors implementing distance advocacy projects and guest lecturing within the curriculum (Decker et al., 2016).

### *Legal, Ethical, and Gatekeeping Considerations*
Distance learning can raise gatekeeping concerns related to laws and ethics creating implications for both counselor educators and counseling students. For one counselor, educators ensure the competency of students entering the profession. Counselor educators should clearly provide were to review ethical standards as it relates to the profession (Learner-content). Counselor educators taking part in distance education must be aware of potential concerns for their students because of the evolution of distance counseling and distance counselor education. Of particular importance are student engagement issues within distance learning and ensuring remote counselors-in-training can effectively mitigate the crisis, suicidality, and safety planning within teletherapy settings (Mullen et al., 2014). Counselor educators can provide a list of video training and resources to help inform students of common ethical concerns within distance learning (i.e., Learner-Content).

Further within counseling ethical expectations, such as honesty and professionalism, are essential requirements for counselors in training. Professional Counselors are honest and objective in reporting their professional activities. Therefore, dishonesty can be considered a gatekeeping concern for counselor educators. With remote learning, concerns of cheating and dishonesty require transparent and open communication with students (Learner-Instructor). In contrast, educators can use online learning may also be helpful accessibility and the inclusion of shy students or students with learning disabilities (Suen, 2005) as the format may make them feel less intimidated about asking questions or joining in discussions. For example, asynchronous discussion forums or synchronous chat sessions may be helpful for students who desire anonymity. During group discussions, the instructor can also highlight diversity regarding the course material and ask learners to share their own cultural experiences (i.e., Learner-Learner, LearnerInstructional Strategies). This assists students in being more interested in the course and in learning more about other learning differences. Furthermore, group work can incorporate cultural factors within experiential activities like case studies or problem-based projects. However, when encouraging cultural discussions in the course room, the instructor must stress that students demonstrate an appropriate level of respect for each other.

The barriers created by online learning can include students who either find it difficult to express their personal feelings or who seem detached. It is proposed instructors using online formats develop connections with their students to provide feedback to both peers and instructor (i.e., Learner-Instructor, LearnerLearner). Counselor educators can facilitate feedback in distance formats by making rubrics accessible and providing resources to model ethical concerns. Additionally, the use of technology in distance learning can allow for recorded experiential activities, such as mock sessions, which can be reviewed with ease. By providing feedback, students can increase feelings of belongingness and increase self-efficacy toward the profession. The feedback to students can adjust their learning and study habits to complete their educational goals and minimize concerns in the field.
